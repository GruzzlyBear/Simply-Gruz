NOTE: This theme has stopped development. Please use the new Etterna Project build/theme, it's better anyways. The theme still works on the latest builds of Etterna (let me know if it breaks)

Simply Gruz - Simply Love for the discerning keysmasher.
===
o/ This is an edit of Simply Love by dguzek called Simply Gruz. It is designed for 40% mini playfields or smaller, and is semi-inspired by xwidghet's edit. It features a full, top-to-bottom playfield, and other neat features such as DP scoring, music wheel grades, a nicer subtractive scoring and much more. It also focuses on cleanliness and simplicity - a cleaner font and no more of that hearts shit!

Please look at the [wiki](https://github.com/GruzzlyBear/Simply-Gruz/wiki) for more information.
