Simply Gruz - Simply Love for the discerning keysmasher.
===
Ay everyone. This is an edit of Simply Love by dguzek called Simply Gruz. It is designed for 40% mini playfields or smaller, and is semi-inspired by xwidghet's edit. It features a full, top-to-bottom playfield, and other neat features such as DP scoring, music wheel grades, a nicer subtractive scoring and much more. It also focuses on cleanliness and simplicity - a cleaner font and no more of that hearts shit (full black background)!
